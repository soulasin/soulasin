I am a second-year student at the University of Laos, currently pursuing a degree in computer engineering and information technology. My primary interests lie in cyber security, with a focus on blue team (defensive) and red team (offensive) operations. I have gained foundational skills in coding and web development through my coursework and self-directed learning.
